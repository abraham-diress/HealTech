Welcome to our Flutter project! This is a brief guide on how to run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Flutter SDK (version 2.2.3 or higher)
Dart SDK (version 2.13.4 or higher)
Android Studio or Xcode (depending on your platform)
Git
Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository using Git. Open your terminal and enter the following command:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace your-username and your-repository with your own GitHub username and the name of the repository.

Next, navigate to the project directory using the cd command:

```cd your-repository```

Running the Project
Now that you're in the project directory, you can run the project using the flutter run command:

arduino
Copy code
flutter run
This will launch the app on an emulator or on your connected device. If you want to run the app on a specific device, use the -d flag followed by the device ID:


flutter run -d device-id
Replace device-id with the ID of your device. You can get the list of available devices by running the flutter devices command.
